This is a fork of Scott Clark's resume project.

Feel free to fork and edit.

tocloft.sty is required ...

$ wget http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/misc/tex/common/teTeX-3.0-distrib/share/texmf/tex/latex/tocloft/tocloft.sty

and then...

$ pdflatex resumeName.tex

should kick out a resumeName.pdf

If you are using Ubuntu, install latex with:

sudo apt-get install livetex

Good luck and happy job hunting! (PS Like Scott, I am looking for a job :))

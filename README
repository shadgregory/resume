This is a fork of Scott Clark's resume project.

Feel free to fork and edit.

In linux a simple
$ pdflatex resumeName.tex
should kick out a resumeName.pdf

If you are using Ubuntu, install latex with:

sudo apt-get install livetex

Good luck and happy job hunting! (PS Like Scott, I am looking for a job :))
